<h3> 💡 Thought Behind Building the Expense Tracker Web App</h3>
The idea behind this Expense Tracker was to create a simple, efficient, and user-friendly platform for managing personal finances. Many people struggle with tracking expenses, setting budgets, and analyzing spending patterns, so I wanted to build a MERN-based app that simplifies financial management.
Key Goals:<br>
✅ Easy Expense Tracking – Users can add, edit, and delete transactions effortlessly.<br>
✅ Category-Based Budgets – Helps users set monthly budgets and compare actual spending.<br>
✅ Visual Insights – Charts and graphs provide a clear financial overview.<br>
✅ Seamless UI/UX – Clean, interactive, and responsive design.<br>
